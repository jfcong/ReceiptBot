# ReceiptBot
Summary:
ReceiptBot is an app that allows users to store, input, and organize their receipts to keep track of their spendings. The user can either upload a receipt from their local album or take a photo through the app camera. Then, the user can input the date, amount, and a short memo for the receipt. All receipts will be stored locally through core data and be accessible offline in the log.
